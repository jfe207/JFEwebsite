        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Entrepreneur and product manager with experience hiring early-stage design and engineering teams, establishing roadmaps and managing mobile and web projects through their full lifecycle. I was a founding employee and CEO of NYC-based leading mobile app publisher Driven Apps, which published video-based tutorial apps in partnership with professional athletes. We launched 3 iOS products, each featured by Apple and reached Top 10 Best Selling apps in the App Store. Driven was acquired by STACK Media in 2014. Most recently I managed product development as the VP of Product at STACK Media. We launched the company's first direct-to-consumer product, a subscription service for athletes to connect with professional strength coaches and recieve custom one-on-one coaching.
